      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a Front End Web Developer with over 4 years of professional experience building user-focused web applications. My expertise includes Vue.js, JavaScript, D3.js, HTML5, CSS3, and modern development tooling such as Vite, Webpack, and Node.js. I specialize in creating intuitive, accessible, and responsive interfaces that deliver seamless user experiences.</p>
      <p class="line-break">I am especially passionate about data visualization, combining algorithmic problem-solving with creative design to transform complex datasets into engaging, interactive visuals. I enjoy working at the intersection of technical programming and design, with a focus on clarity, usability, and accessibility.</p>
      <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
      <h4>Williams Sonoma - Front End Web Developer</h4>
      <p>At Williams Sonoma, I contribute to a large-scale e-commerce platform, collaborating daily with creative teams, UI/UX designers, site management, product managers, and back end engineers. My work centers on implementing scalable CSS solutions that deliver consistent and responsive designs across multiple brands and devices. I also apply vanilla JavaScript through the company's CMS to extend functionality and improve user interactions. This role strengthens my ability to work cross-functionally in a fast-paced environment while ensuring quality, accessibility, and brand consistency.</p>
      <h4>Turner Engineering - Front End Web Developer and Data Engineer</h4>
      <p class="line-break">At Turner Engineering, I design and develop Vue 3 and Vite applications featuring D3.js-powered data visualizations that model time savings from synchronizing traffic signals with SF Metro vehicles. I engineer a data pipeline that collects real-time traffic data from 511.org SF Bay, then process and curate datasets into structured JSON files using custom JavaScript algorithms. To improve deployment efficiency, I implement a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, enabling automated testing, build optimization, and production deployment of Vue + D3 applications. This work combines front end architecture, data engineering, and workflow automation to deliver scalable, data-driven web solutions.</p>
      <h3>Beyond Work</h3>
      <p>I am based in San Francisco, CA, and I am always eager to explore new frameworks, libraries, and design patterns. Outside of coding, I enjoy playing baseball, cooking, and spending time with my dog, Moose.</p>
